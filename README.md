## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url] your-project-name
   cd your-project-name
   ```

2. Start the Docker containers:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

3. Access the Magento installation:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```

### Using the Helper Scripts

This project includes several helper scripts located in the `bin/` directory:

- **bash**: Access the container's bash shell
  ```bash
  ./bin/bash
  ```

- **deploy**: Deploy your application
  ```bash
  ./bin/deploy
  ```

## Configuration

### Docker Compose

The `docker-compose.yml` file defines the services required for the Magento 2 application. You can modify this file to adjust service configurations according to your needs.

### Nginx

The Nginx configuration files are located in the `nginx/` directory:
- `default.conf`: Contains the server block configuration for Magento 2
- `proxy.conf`: Contains proxy-related settings

## Development Workflow

1. Make changes to your Magento 2 code within the `src/` directory (which is mounted as a volume in the Docker container)
2. Any changes made to the code will be immediately reflected in the running application
3. Use the provided helper scripts for common tasks

## Troubleshooting

### Container Access

To access the main application container:
```bash
./bin/bash
```

### Logs

To view container logs:
```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

To view specific service logs:
```bash
docker compose logs -f [service-name]
```

## Customization

### Adding Custom PHP Extensions

Edit the `Dockerfile` to include additional PHP extensions or packages.

### Modifying Nginx Configuration

Modify the files in the `nginx/` directory to adjust web server settings.

## Deployment
